version info
=============
*   v0.2
*   Python 3.6.2

Using tutorial
=============
1. Download it of course.
2. Double click "vote.exe".
3. Click "Start Voting" and make sure the CLI(the black shit) is alive.
4. Go to sleep.

*   I highly recommend to click the "Stop Voting" button first if you want to exit the program. 
*   Notice that if any ERROR occur, the CLI and the ChromeDriver will be closed automatically.
*   If you find that your contribution number stuck for a long time, just restart this program or click the start button again.
